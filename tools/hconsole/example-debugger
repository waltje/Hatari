# Show disassembly from address in A0 when debugger is entered:
lock regaddr disasm a0

# Track when GEMDOS is called with the Dgetdrv() opcode
# (happens e.g. when EmuTOS console prints the prompt):
breakpoint  GemdosOpcode = 0x19  :lock

# NOTE: in addition to information specified by "lock" command
# being printed, ":lock" flag causes breakpoint hit to just to
# be traced, instead of emulation dropping to debugger.
#
# This is important when using hconsole because entering the Hatari
# debugger (and its line editing) will mess up the terminal from
# which hconsole is run from.  At least until user has blindly
# typed "cont" to the Hatari debugger so that Hatari emulation
# continues.
